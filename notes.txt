Cra is npm package to create react applications 

command to create react app is 

npx create-react-app appname


we have opened this project in visual studio code 
using open folder option 


FIle Structure 


node_modules -- is all the js pacakges required to run your project 

any 3rd party package also u install it will also be installed in node_modules

public is the static folder folder which contains all the static resources 

static resources are the resources which can be accessed by  browser

src folder cntains all your code or source code



package.json is the main file for any js package or project be it angular node or vue js or any javascript

package.json contains all the info about your project 

what are scripts used what all are dependencies veriosn name description


to start react project 

npm start

go inside project folder and execute 
npm start


a http server is created by react tool and it serves index.html on 3000 port number


An application which consists of one body tag is known as single page application 

All other views are rendered on requirement 

without reloading the body the content is changed that is single page application

React is used due to a concept known as virtual Dom
DOM - Document Object model 

all the html elements are converted into an object structure known as DOM which contains all the information about these html elements 
likes =  740
{likes}

741

we have increment number 
but how would html comes to know that likes value is changed 

it will compare the data what is displayed and hat is changed 

so this comparision of the data like what is changed take time

to make it easie reacted introduced virtual dom 

virtual dom is the lighter representation of actual dom which is easy to compare or traverse

if heavier dom with the lighter dom 

comoaring actual with the virtual is faster compared to actual with actual 

REact is faster to load the changes

NOte -- change detection or data difference is easy to figure out 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Jsx -- react using jsx to achieve virtual dom-
jsx - javascript xml it means when we write html like like structure in js file it is jsx 

javascript extension becualse i feel reaact is extending js capabilities to understand html tags also 

in jsx instead of class 
we will be using className="btn btn-warning"

all the components in react must be used with caps letter 

lets u have create a button component 
if u use <button></button>

u must define ur components in caps 
example <Button></Button>

Rule 1) className
Rule 2 caps letter for components 
Rule 3) all the htmls tags in jsx must be closed 
Rule 4) style must be used in object format 

in normal html u may or may not close tags 
<input>
<br>
<img>

but while in using in jsx or react u must close these 

<input  /> or <input></input>

<a style="pointer:none">

in react we use it like 

style  = "height:100px;width:23px" -- Normal
style={{height:"20px",width:"20px"}} -- JSX


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Ecmascript --- the specification of how to use javascript 

to declare a variable we have somehing knwon as var 

specifying the var is used to declare variables is ecmascript

Es5 and es6 

Es5 is understood by browsers es6 is partially understood 

we convert es6 syntax into es5 and then send it to browsers 

this process is known as transpilling 
Babel js


es 6 have some new features which were missing in es 5

example 

variable hoisiting -- 

var name  is declration 
name = "kyle" definition 


js takes all the declarations to the topof the code 

hoisitng 

local are the things defined inside a function 

but for is a block not a function 

let is block variable 

var is global/local depends on if u have declared a var inside a function it will be local

to use anything in another files we have a keyword  knknown as export 

one file can have one default export 

import x from "./path"
above line will go to that path and copy the efualt thing export in that x

we must share project without node_modules 

other person will install it using npm install 

npm install will find out file package.json and install all the dependencies mentioned into that

CRA to create this app 

this cra converts all ur es 6 code into es 5 and then it send it to browsers 



>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Vd is in memory representation of Actual DOM 

ReactDom in the body of index.html

it insterts the ReactDom inside the body -- where 

By default it inserts inside a div whose id is root -- how did we figure this out 


Lets go to index.js


React tool basically takes a component and inserts ReactDom along with that coponent inside document of you index.html

Component which is getting rendered inside ReactDOM is known as Root Component

what the heck is component ?

Component is  nothing but just a view/html 

in React How we define components 

Step 1 we will create a file with component name
Step 2 create a function and return a view/html from that
Step 3 Export that function 
Step 4 Whereever u want to use/display that component import it there and use it as a html tag  

Static files/assets are stored in public folder 
we will store our images into public folder


When creating components it should be created in a manner that we pass the inputs and those inputs should be used for data 

when passing the inputs to a component that process is known as passing the Props 


Props are the inputs passed to a child component from parent component 

App.js 

in App component we are using Cake component App is parent of Cake 

App will pass inputs to Cake component -- How ?

<Cake x=10 y=20 z=30 />

x y z are known as props 

Functional 

Class Based 

Functional are stateless components 
Classbased components are state full components

State --? State is data of component at any point of time


Functional components lack state  
once they are rendered they cannot show anything updated

For that we need statefull components / class based components 


React became public in 2013

2013 -2019 it was not possible 

2019 they have introduced something using which we can update state using functional components  (React Hooks)


components are used via html tags 

so by just looking at the tag we can figure what type of component it is 

Human lifecycle --  we take birth we enjoy life and we die  


comes on the screen and leaves the screen

constructor()

render()

componentDidMount()  -- rednering is succesfult 

componentWillUnmount() -- just before leaving the screen 

componentDidUpdate() -- when u call setState() didupdate gets called


EVENT HANDLING IN REACT ---- 

Javascript events are what ever user performs 
click 
copy
change
select
cut 
paste 

events in react are used like 

onEvent={mthodname}

Note - I REPEAT DO NOT CALL THE METHOD ONLY PASS THE REFERENCE

onChange={getValue()} -- Incorrect
onChange = {getText}

line 287 can be read react will call getText function on Change event 

SUPERNOTE : Arrow functionals were created mainly to handle this operator


this operator loses its value 

arrwo functions are used to preseve the scope of this operator

// to dispaly a list in React 

we never know how many elements are there in an array 

we will be repeating using map function 

MAP operator 

so first u need to figure out that what do u want to repeat 

Cake 
button
input box 

or a table row 
that element u need to return from map function

React routing 

npm install react-router react-router-dom

Routing is basically ur app checks for path entered into url bar 
and loading the corresponding component inside the app is routing 


what are routes 

defining which component is going to appear on which path is knwon as route 


React Fragments a wrapper to contain elements together without creating itslef in DOM

being playng role of react developer 
our only role is to take inputs from user like drop down checkobox radio buttons file buttons color calendar time 

and send it backend and take the response and show it to user 

what data what language it is build upon 

for us (Frontend developer ) its just an api address 

abc.com/apiendpoint

123.4.43.3/api/endpointname 


react is going to use either internal function of js known as fetch 

alert()
console.log()

fetch()


but we are going to use 3rd party library called axios 


npm install axios 

Api call comes with url+method and request JSON 

we are searching flights from india to sigapore 

Rest api mostly deal with json 


JSON javascript object notation 

var user = {
    name:"Ashu Lekhi"
}

{"name":"Ashu Lekhi"}

whenever we have to make an api call 

we call a function 

import axios from "axios"

axios({
    url:"api url"
    method:"get"
})

axios({
    url:"api url",
    method:"get",
    data:JSON
})

If we have to send any headers 
axios({
    url:"api url"
    method:"get",
    headers:{

    }
})

we are in process to take birth 
take birth 
we get updated 
and we die someday 

component is constructed then it rendered once it is successfully rendered we can 

it ismounted and when we update the state of cmponent we call componentDidUpdate()


component is leavng screen it will unmount(

)

constructor()
render()
componentDidMount()
componentDidUpdate()
componentWillUnmount()

/:id Here id is considered as route parameter 

/abc
/ashu-Lekhi
/a74834384
/345849354


pass the data in ROutes ? 

Route Params ?

Route Query 

/ashu is it a route 

/ashu? question mark stands for route query 

/ashu?doubt=componentdidmount

doubt is the query variable and componentdid mount is the value for that query varibale  


in react router 6 programatical navigation is only done using hooks 


hooks cant be used by class based components


it will locate package.json and install all the modules mentioned into dependencies

What is state ?
State is the data of component at a specific time ? right ?

how many components 
may be n 
one component doesn't know about any other component 

2 friends who had a fight using 3rd friend 

Redux 
due to its prinicipals 

SST-- single source of truth all the data will stay in a single object referred as stor 
Store is modified only by reducers 

TCS 

Software developer is allowed to access TCS portals ?

functions 
when some functions are given special privilaeges to modify the state of the store they are known as reducers 

TCSIANS 
TCSERS 


Reducers 

TCS -- ur id or ur employee id 

function(state,action){

}

function AshuReducer(state={}, action)

i am providing training 
Action is nothing but just a plain js object which tell u what to do 

example {type:"Develop a react app"}

{type:"Do Asginment 2"}

{type:"Npm install "}

{type:"Buy Beer"}

we will go to apple store we will make a request give me iphone 13 256gb black colour

dispatch --- is a request we request an action 

Component dispatches an action to the store. reducers on the store will listen to u and if ur request is suitable enough they will do the needful or they will simly ignore


Store/state -- is a plain object it will hold all the application data

reducers -- special functions to modify store 

action -- plain objects which are dispatch


.dispatch(ACTION)

.getState()

Redux -- is a 3rd party tool to manage state of your application

i will let u by confirming it from edureka 

i am binded to whom ? Edureka 

Components with the Redux
if redux changes component who was binded to it will also change automatically


Scenario 
Login 

Navbar component 

Navbar is not aware about happenings in Login Component 

Login component will write the data in redux store 

Navbar will watch that data from redux store 

the moment store data changes navbar will be notified 


redux is 3rd party standalone tool 
standalone means it can work without react as well with any other thing 

redux

requirement is to connect redux with our react app 
for that we will need react-redux

npm i react-redux

api call 

result 

dispatch the result to Redux

props.dispatch({
    type:"STORE_COURSES",
    payload:response.data.courses
})

console.log("response.data)

Will you work on a React Project ?

Ashu will u work on a project --- i will say i will let you know
you guys response to me 

component was dispatching the action with data and reducers were storing it into store

we will dispatch an action and network call will be made in redux and further it will store the data based on the outcome of api call

I repeat -- api call i.e async task will now take place in Redux 

For async operations in Redux we need middlewares


A promise is a state returned by a function which says i will definitely come back with either YES or No 
but i will be coming back 

function Melaku(){
    return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
        if(tech=="React"){
            resolve()
        }
        else{
            reject()
        }
    })
}

Melaku()

logging  middleware
dispatch will write a console log with date and action type

what is a function ?

is a piece of code which takes values and return value

a function can only return how many things ?

1 - ONE 

to return multiple values over time 

we have special functions known as generators 

function ashu (){
    return "something"
}

function *rakshit(){

}

// u can pause execution and resume from their 


What is redux-saga 

Redux saga is  a middleware of redux 
middleware -- one is u wrote that custom middle ware 

3rd party middleware -- Redux-saga 

npm install redux-saga 

saga oofers u a benifit of linking different sagas with different actions 

lets say 
Watson for cake dispatches

Micheal for cart dispatches

Mahmoud for login dispatches

Rajan for order dispatches

Mathew  -- dealing with angular

Sagas 
we will write different sagas for different functions

we can write specific middlewares for specific dispatches



When we click on a cake 
an action is dispatched 
it is executed by saga middleware saga brings the details from api
based on the response of api we update the store using reducers 

store using map statetoprops function updates the component


// this component is getting details from props and just displaying it


// api call is handled by redux 

// react says if u are using redux put all ur api calls in redux and make your component only displaying the data and not doing anythign else


react launched in which year ? Fb released it in 2013 

2019 only class based components had state 

functional component and it needed state there was only one way to write a class based component for that 


Hooks 

What is hooks -- Hooks are functions 
What are react hooks ? They are functions simple enough 

our 1st react hook 
useState() is one of react hooks that provide state to a stateless component

this.state = {
    count:0
}

this.setState({
    count:this.state.count++
})

var [property,propertyhandlerfunction] =  useState(initialvalue)
var [count,setCount] =  useState(0)
setCount(count++)

functions in order to execute they don't create objects 
classes do create 

1st hook - useState()
2nd hook - useEffect() is a hook which is called when a component is rendered and updated 


useEffect is called first time and everytime state updates 

useEffect to be called only for first time not on any change



useEffect(()=>{}) first time and on every update

useEffect(()=>{},[]) epmty array is known of list of dependencies only first time not on any update 

useEffect(()=>{},[count,mahmoud]) list of dependencies has mentioned count that means it will be called if the value of count will be changed

useNavigate() is a hook provided by react-router-dom 

Rules of Hooks
Hooks cant be used with classbased components 


useContext()

Context is using what a parent can pass data to n level of child 

level 1 parent can pass data to 7th level child
